Modern Man, by George Carlin

I am a modern man,
A man for the millennium,
Digital and smoke free.

A diversified, multi-cultural,
Post-modern deconstructionist;
Politically, anatomically and ecologically incorrect.

I’ve been uplinked and downloaded,
I’ve been inputted and outsourced.
I know the upside of downsizing,
I know the downside of upgrading.

I’m a high-tech low-life.
A cutting edge, state-of-the-art,
Bi-coastal multi-tasker,
And I can give you a gigabyte in a nanosecond.

I’m new-wave, but I’m old school;
And my inner child is outward bound.

I’m a hot-wired, heat seeking,
Warm-hearted cool customer;
Voice activated and bio-degradable.

I interface with my database;
My database is in cyberspace;
So I’m interactive, I’m hyperactive,
And from time to time I’m radioactive.

Behind the eight ball, ahead of the curve,
Ridin' the wave, dodgin' the bullet
Pushin' the envelope.

I’m on point, on task, on message,
And off drugs.

I’ve got no need for coke and speed;
I've got no urge to binge and purge.

I’m in the moment, on the edge,
Over the top, but under the radar.

A high-concept, low-profile,
Medium-range ballistic missionary.

A street-wise smart bomb.
A top-gun bottom-feeder.

I wear power ties, I tell power lies,
I take power naps, I run victory laps.

I’m a totally ongoing, big-foot, slam-dunk,
Rainmaker with a pro-active outreach.

A raging workaholic, a working rageaholic;
Out of rehab and in denial.

I’ve got a personal trainer,
A personal shopper,
A personal assistant,
And a personal agenda.

You can’t shut me up;
You can’t dumb me down.

Cause I’m tireless and I’m wireless.
I’m an alpha-male on beta-blockers.
